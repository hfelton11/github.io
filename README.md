This site was TRYING to be clean and beautiful, but it really is not...

# Here

## First, i was trying to fork from [A There-link](https://www.romanzolotarev.com/standalone.html).

That turned into a not-quite-followable situation and i am too tired to bother fixing up all of the issues with it...
In particular, it did not list all of the details (and ORDER of inputs) needed to do things correctly...
And, rather than having a license requiring notations-of-copyright - i have chosen the [A Unlicense-License](https://github.com/componentjs/component/issues/261) and it would conflict with his earlier MIT-attribution-license...
However, for the spirit of it - i DID fork his repository [A Kinda-here-link](https://github.com/hfelton11/jekyll-minimalist/blob/master/index.md)

## Second, i am just putting this about-placeholder here as a placeholder.

My ACTUAL goal is to setup a simple website for my partner to self-publish his Haiku...
Another semi-goal is to migrate my own simple website back to my own-control...

# Ending

If you have made it this-far, then if _I_ make it any farther (or is it further) i will include followon links below...

- link 1
- link 2
- link 3, etc...
