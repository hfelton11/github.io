This site was TRYING to be clean and beautiful, but it really is not...

Apparently, my semi-copy of RomanZ's markdown-lesson [There-too](https://www.romanzolotarev.com/markdown.html) was unsuccessful...  sigh...

# Here

## First, i was trying to fork from [A There-link](https://www.romanzolotarev.com/standalone.html).

That turned into a not-quite-followable situation and i am too tired to bother fixing up all of the issues with it...
In particular, it did not list all of the details (and ORDER of inputs) needed to do things correctly...
And, rather than having a license requiring notations-of-copyright - i have chosen the [A Unlicense-License](https://github.com/componentjs/component/issues/261) and it would conflict with his earlier MIT-attribution-license...
However, for the spirit of it - i DID fork his repository [A Kinda-here-link](https://github.com/hfelton11/jekyll-minimalist/blob/master/index.md)

## Second, i am just putting this about-placeholder here as a placeholder.

My ACTUAL goal is to setup a simple website for my partner to self-publish his Haiku...
Another semi-goal is to migrate my own simple website back to my own-control...

## Third, i guess i will just document within this stupid markdown-page until i get to something usable...
### Starting out...
- Using a hackintosh, running high-sierra, updated asof 2018-08-09 (i think 10.13.6)...
- i have admin priveleges, but want to setup for partner who is a regular-user also...
- i know enough to be dangerous, but not completely experienced with where-we-are-going...
- Sub-goal right now is to get to a point where i can update THIS website from my "mac" easily...
### STEPS online...
- goto [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com) and get myself setup correctly...

If you are not on github, then you will need to get started with the MAIN github process first...
I have been on github for awhile already, so i just needed to make sure that i signed up for the correct pages-name...
In particular, i took some screenshots (will not link-to here yet) but the important comments were:
1. needed to login to github main-site...
1. sign up/in for pages with my username (hfelton11)...
1. i mistakenly (?) setup a public (vs. private) repository...
1. select master branch (not docs folder or whatever)...
1. (i start to get fuzzy at the following details, and odds-are they will change by the time you read this anyways)...
1. selected jekyll with minimal-theme, iirc...
1. selected unlicense and blank-first-project using a gitignore for jekyll-stuff
1. finally i ended up back in github main-site...

- look at our new repository for pages... [github.com/hfelton11/github.io](https://github.com/hfelton11/github.io)
- do NOT follow romanZ and fork his repository because that ends up giving you a second/orphaned repository...
### STEPS on local-terminal...
- goto [https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)

**Something is not-quite-right in above descriptions, and i am confused again...  sigh...**
